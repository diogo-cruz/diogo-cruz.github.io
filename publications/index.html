                    <p class="description">Ever wonder if chess AIs actually "think ahead" like humans do? I dug into Leela Chess Zero's neural network and found it's genuinely considering moves up to 7 steps in the future, not just pattern matching. The cool part is it's actually weighing multiple possible game lines simultaneously, which explains why it plays so well.</p>

                    <p class="description">We discovered that when you train language models with human feedback (RLHF), they get biased toward learning "easy to extract" features that the reward model can easily spot. This might sound good, but it actually limits how sophisticated the model's reasoning can become. It's like teaching a student to only give answers that are easy to grade—they might miss more nuanced solutions.</p>

                    <p class="description">We figured out how to efficiently create these special quantum states called GHZ and W states that are super useful for quantum computing. The big win was making algorithms that scale logarithmically instead of exponentially, and we actually got them working on IBM's quantum computers with up to 16 qubits. This became pretty popular (148 citations!) because we doubled the number of qubits people could reliably entangle.</p>

Our method needs up to 100x fewer quantum resources than existing approaches while getting better quality entanglement. We can handle pretty noisy conditions (10% error per Bell pair) with just 16 entangled pairs, which is great for near-term quantum networks.</p>

Sounds crazy, but it actually works better than traditional syndrome decoding while being computationally cheaper. We made quantum random linear codes actually practical to decode, which people knew was theoretically possible but nobody had figured out how to do efficiently.</p>

We covered everything from fusion energy to space plasmas, and the cool thing is we keep updating it as both fields evolve. It's basically a roadmap for where quantum computing could make a real difference in understanding plasmas.</p>

                    <p class="description">Instead of doing quantum gates one after another, we figured out how to drive multiple transmon qubits at the same time to create native multi-qubit gates. This is faster and more accurate than the usual sequential approach, which is great because quantum coherence doesn't last long. It's a hardware-level trick that could make quantum computers significantly more efficient.</p>

                    <p class="description">The tricky thing about quantum error correction is that even your error correction process introduces errors—it's errors all the way down! We developed fault-tolerant decoding for quantum random codes that can handle about 10% error rates even when the measurements and gates used for error correction are themselves noisy. This is a big step toward making quantum computers that actually work reliably in the real world.</p>

                    <p class="description">For my master's thesis, I looked at using quantum computers to simulate the strong nuclear force—the thing that holds protons and neutrons together. This is notoriously hard to compute classically because of how quantum chromodynamics works at low energies. It was early days for quantum simulations in particle physics, but we were exploring whether quantum computers might eventually crack these problems that classical supercomputers struggle with.</p>
