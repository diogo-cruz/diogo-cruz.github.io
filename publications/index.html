                    <p class="venue">arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.21552, 2025</p>
                    <p class="description">This work investigates the sophisticated look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically analyzing how the Leela Chess Zero policy network considers future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. The research reveals that these networks develop context-dependent look-ahead behavior that varies significantly based on specific chess positions, can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, and considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. This provides valuable insights into the emergence of sophisticated planning capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of how AI systems develop complex reasoning abilities.</p>

                    <p class="description">This collaborative research examines how reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) affects what language models learn to prioritize during training. The study reveals that RLHF creates systematic biases toward features that are more easily extracted or interpretable by the reward model, potentially limiting the diversity of learned representations. This finding has important implications for AI safety and alignment efforts, as it suggests that RLHF may inadvertently constrain the kinds of reasoning patterns that models develop, favoring more transparent but potentially less sophisticated approaches to problem-solving. The work contributes to the growing understanding of how training methodologies shape AI behavior and reliability.</p>

                    <p class="description">This highly influential work presents efficient quantum algorithms for creating important multi-particle entangled states called GHZ and W states, which serve as fundamental resources for quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing applications. The research provides both theoretical algorithms with logarithmic depth complexity and practical experimental demonstrations on IBM's quantum computers up to 16 qubits. With 148 citations, this paper has become a cornerstone reference for preparing multipartite entangled states, bridging the gap between theoretical quantum information concepts and practical implementation on real quantum hardware. The work demonstrates the capability to robustly build states with about twice the number of quantum bits that were previously achieved, representing a significant advance in quantum state preparation.</p>

                    <p class="venue">Quantum, vol. 8, page 1476, 2024 (7 citations)</p>
                    <p class="description">This work presents a novel approach to purifying quantum entanglement between distant parties by adapting classical error correction techniques (specifically, the GRAND algorithm) to the quantum domain. The method offers substantial advantages over existing hashing protocols, requiring significantly fewer quantum resources (up to 100 times fewer in some cases) while achieving higher fidelity entangled states. The research demonstrates that their protocol can purify states with noise on the order of 10% per Bell pair even with small ensembles of just 16 pairs, making it particularly relevant for near-term quantum networks with limited resources. This work opens the path to practical and efficient entanglement purification using hashing-based methods with feasible computational costs.</p>

                    <p class="venue">IEEE Access, vol. 11, pp. 119446-119461, 2023 (21 citations)</p>
                    <p class="description">This paper introduces an innovative approach to quantum error correction that leverages statistical knowledge about noise patterns to improve decoding efficiency. Rather than using traditional syndrome-based decoding, the method "guesses" the most likely errors based on their probability distribution, providing better performance while maintaining computational feasibility. The work extends the classical GRAND (guessing random additive noise decoding) approach to quantum random linear codes (QRLCs), which were known to be possible to construct but whose decoding was not yet feasible. This represents an important advance in making quantum error correction more practical for real quantum systems, where understanding the noise characteristics can lead to more efficient error correction protocols.</p>

The work addresses the fundamental challenge of extracting high-resolution information about quantum systems despite the limitations present in current quantum hardware. By developing superresolution techniques, the research opens new possibilities for quantum simulations in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, potentially enabling the study of complex quantum phenomena that are computationally intractable for classical computers.

                    <p class="description">This work demonstrates a hardware-level approach to implementing efficient multi-qubit quantum gates by driving multiple transmon qubits simultaneously in superconducting quantum computers. The synchronous driving technique reduces gate execution time and improves fidelity compared to sequential gate operations, representing a practical advance in quantum hardware control that could significantly accelerate quantum computations. The research addresses one of the key challenges in scaling quantum computers: how to perform complex operations efficiently while maintaining the delicate quantum coherence required for reliable computation. The native multi-qubit gates approach offers a promising path toward more efficient quantum processors.</p>

                    <p class="venue">arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.01658, 2024 (1 citation)</p>
                    <p class="description">Building on previous work on quantum error correction, this paper addresses the critical challenge of implementing fault-tolerant quantum random linear codes with practical computational overhead. The research introduces advanced decoding techniques that can handle imperfect measurement and gate operations during the error correction process itself—a crucial requirement since real quantum computers introduce errors even during error correction procedures. The work demonstrates a threshold error rate of approximately 10% in the asymptotic limit while considering realistic noise levels in preparation, measurement, and gate operations. This represents an important step toward building reliable quantum computing systems that can operate effectively despite the inherent noise and imperfections in current quantum hardware.</p>

                    <p class="venue">Master's Thesis, 2019</p>
                    <p class="description">This master's thesis explores the application of quantum computing techniques to simulate hadronic systems—the complex interactions between quarks and gluons that form protons, neutrons, and other particles governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The work investigates how quantum computers might eventually enable more accurate simulations of the strong nuclear force, which remains one of the most computationally challenging problems in theoretical physics due to the non-perturbative nature of QCD at low energies. This research represents early foundational work in quantum simulations of high-energy physics, contributing to the growing field of quantum simulations for fundamental physics and establishing the groundwork for future advances in computational particle physics.</p>
